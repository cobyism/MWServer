MeshWarpServer SE
=================
		
MeshWarpServer is a MaxMSPJitter-Patch for OSX and Windows. It allows you to create video projection installation that wrap any kind of video-content onto real world objects.

Capture Modul8, Processing, Flash, Unity3D, Blender, Torque,  Jitter, GEM, Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office, Terminal, or any other Mac OS X application in realtime (with the help of a capture card or via Syphon (OSX only)) and project the captured movie as a perfect fit on every imaginable object with the help of one or many beamer.
	
MeshWarpServer has been optimized for large movies (up to 8000x1200 pixels), however it requires a high performance hardware to run smoothly.
